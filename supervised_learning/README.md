# Customer Engagement Research

The project aims to increase customer engagement for an online store, 
which sells a variety of products ranging from home goods and small appliances to cosmetics and groceries. 
Recent reports indicate a decline in customer activity, and acquiring new customers has become less effective due to the store's widespread recognition. 
The proposed solution focuses on retaining existing customers through personalized offers based on data-driven insights and business modeling. The project involves developing a model to predict 
the likelihood of a customer's purchasing activity decreasing over the next three months. 
Using this model and additional financial data, customer segments will be identified to create personalized strategies for boosting their engagement. The implementation requires data analysis, 
feature engineering, and testing multiple machine learning models to select the most effective one for this purpose.
