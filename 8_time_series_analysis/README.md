# Development of an Order Volume Prediction System.

A taxi company collected historical data on taxi orders at airports for 6 months. 
To attract more drivers during peak load periods, the number of taxi orders for the next hour was predicted. 
The data was resampled by hours. The Dickey-Fuller test was performed to check for stationarity of the series. 
LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor were used for training.
