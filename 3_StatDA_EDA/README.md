# Video game sales analysis for an online store  

In this project, a historical data analysis of an online store, which sells video games worldwide, was conducted. 
The goal was to identify patterns that define a gameâ€™s success, enabling effective advertising campaign planning and focusing on potentially popular products. 
The project included several stages: data preparation, exploratory analysis, profiling users from different regions, and testing hypotheses about user preferences and ratings. 
The study analyzed sales across different platforms and genres and examined the impact of reviews and the ESRB rating on game success. 
The final results helped identify the most profitable market segments and develop recommendations for further game promotion.
