# Determining the value of cars

A used car sales service is developing an application to attract new customers, 
allowing users to quickly find out the market value of their vehicle. 

Based on data on technical characteristics, configuration and prices of other cars, 
a model for predicting prices of used cars has been developed. The quality of the prediction, 
the training time of the model and the prediction time of the model are important for the customer. 
The models studied are LinearRegressor and LightGBMRegressor.
