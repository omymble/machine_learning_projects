# Dairy Cow Selection

The project helps a farm choose the best cows to grow its herd. 
The farmer wants to buy cows that produce a lot of milk and also have great-tasting milk. 
To make the right decision, 2 machine learning models are built. 
One model will predict how much milk a cow can produce in a year, and the other will predict if the milk will meet the farmerâ€™s taste standards. 
The data for the project is provided by the "EcoFerma" association. 
With these models, farmers can select cows that will give at least 6000 kg of milk every year and maintain high milk quality, reducing the risk of buying unsuitable cows. 
This will help the farm expand efficiently and successfully.
