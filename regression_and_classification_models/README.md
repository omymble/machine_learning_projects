# HR-analytics

This project consists of two subprojects focused on HR analytics.
The goal is to apply machgit resetine learning techniques to help businesses better understand 
and manage their workforce. Both tasks rely on real-world HR data to address key 
challenges in employee monitoring and retention. 
These projects reflect common scenarios in HR analytics, 
where data-driven insights support decision-making.

## 1. Predicting Employee satisfaction rate

The first task is to develop a machine learning model that predicts an employeeâ€™s satisfaction level based on available HR data. 
Satisfaction scores, ranging from 0 to 1, are typically collected through feedback surveys, 
but administering them at scale is resource-intensive. 
To address this, predictive modeling is used to estimate satisfaction levels for all employees. 
<p>
Two algorithms are applied and compared: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.


## 2. Predicting Employee dismissal

The second task involves building a classification model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. 
Employee attrition poses operational and financial risks, so early detection is key for strategic HR planning. 
<p>
This task uses a range of classification algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to identify the most effective approach for attrition prediction.
